# 24967 Patient Connector Technical Manual

[Sample][https://www.medtronic.com/content/dam/emanuals/watermarks/CONTRIB_252088E.pdf]

**Sample overview:** I wrote this technical manual to support a set of 2 new app-based
programmers. The information architecture of this manual was tricky because it had to support
multiple programmers with different app installation processes that could be updated
independently of this manual.

I worked closely with the Human Factors Engineer/UX Designer to develop, test, and validate
the level of information as appropriate for the end users, which wasnâ€™t typical for most IFU (Instructions for use)
development projects.

This content traces to roughtly 3,000 different laws, regulations, and standards that govern medical devices. I developed and maintained the requirements and tracebility to them.

The product is considered a medical device and went through the design controls verification
and validation process prior to release.

**Audience:** Cardiac clinic staff (typically nurses) or clinic/hospital IT staff

**Output formats:** PDF (electronic and printed)

**Tools used:** MAPS (Medtronic XML-based content management system using oXygen editor). 

**Note:** The watermark
in blue is required per global regulatory agencies to indicate that this is not the current version of
the IFU.
