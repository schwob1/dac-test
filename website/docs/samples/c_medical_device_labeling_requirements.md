# Medical Device Labeling Requirements

The term "labeling" for medical devices includes instructions for use (IFUs), package labels, and device labels. 

There are four different types of sources for labeling requirements of medical devices: 
    * laws 
    * regulations
    * standards
    * guidance documents


# Normalized Data Format
Each type of labeling requirement source follows different conventions for how to describe the requirements. We'll follow a normalized format using the following formula:

```
The (labeling type) shall (requirement) when (condition).
```
